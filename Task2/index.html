          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p>
            Web development involves creating and maintaining websites, encompassing various aspects such as web design, web programming, and database management. It includes tasks from building simple static web pages to developing complex web applications and services. Web developers use a range of programming languages and tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Django to create dynamic and interactive user experiences. The process typically involves client-side (front-end) development, which focuses on the visual and interactive elements, and server-side (back-end) development, which handles data processing and server logic. Effective web development ensures that websites are fast, responsive, and user-friendly, catering to the needs of businesses and users alike.

          <h3>App Development</h3>
          <p>

It includes native development for specific platforms like iOS and Android, as well as cross-platform development using frameworks like React Native and Flutter to create apps that work on multiple platforms.
